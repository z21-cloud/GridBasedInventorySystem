I have finished working on the GRID-based inventory system today. In the next few days, I will refactor the code and upload changes to GitHub. All future updates will also be published in this repository.

Day 1:
And so, I started refactoring the code, aiming to make it more "correct" from an OOP/SOLID perspective, but I accidentally broke the entire architecture :D
Therefore, I rolled back to the previous version and started the refactoring all over again.

I re-created git repository, because I didn't use .gitignore and my project got too manu useless files. I Hope I upload all correctly now.
